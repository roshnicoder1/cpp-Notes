## What is C++
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.

C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

## Difference between c and c++


No.	C	C++
1)	C follows the procedural style programming.	C++ is multi-paradigm. It supports both procedural and object oriented.
2)	Data is less secured in C.	In C++, you can use modifiers for class members to make it inaccessible for outside users.
3)	C follows the top-down approach.	C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
4)	C does not support function overloading.	C++ supports function overloading.
5)	In C, you can't use functions in structure.	In C++, you can use functions in structure.
6)	C does not support reference variables.	C++ supports reference variables.
7)	In C, scanf() and printf() are mainly used for input/output.	C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to perform input and output operations.
8)	Operator overloading is not possible in C.	Operator overloading is possible in C++.
9)	C programs are divided into procedures and modules	C++ programs are divided into functions and classes.
10)	C does not provide the feature of namespace.	C++ supports the feature of namespace.
11)	Exception handling is not easy in C. It has to perform using other functions.	C++ provides exception handling using Try and Catch block.
12)	C does not support the inheritance.	C++ supports inheritance.

## C++ Features

Simple
### Machine Independent or Portable
Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.

Mid-level programming language
Structured programming language
Rich Library
### Memory Management
It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.
Fast Speed
Pointers
Recursion
### Extensible
C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.

Object Oriented
Compiler based

### getch() The getch() function asks for a single character. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.
### A variable can start with underscore.
## DataTypes

int 2byte
long int 4 byte
float 4 byte
double 8 byte

### The major difference between C and C++ is the limit on the length of the name of the variable. ANSI C considers only the first 32 characters in a name while ANSI C++ imposes no limit on the length of the name.
